<h1 style="font-size: xx-large;">Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1> 
<p>
Dear Eileen,<br><br>
Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
of your <ins>PhD</ins> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
</p>

<h1 style="font-size: xx-large;">Starting Dates</h1>
<p>
 We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
 could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
<ul> 
    <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li><br>
</ul> 
    Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer.<br><br>
    You can find more information about <a href="importantuniversity.com"><font color = "purple">important university dates</font></a> on our website.
</p>
<h1 style="font-size: xx-large;">Subjects of study</h1>
<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br>
somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
by are as follows, in order of priority:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tempratures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>

<li><ins>HTML</ins> and <ins>CSS </ins>constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol><br>
So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br> 
research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
</p>

<h1 style="font-size: xx-large;">Exotic dance moves</h1>
<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
<p>Polynesian chicken dance

<dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around</dd>
<dd>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.</dd></p>
<p>Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>
<dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which</dd>
<dd>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably</dd>
<dd>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired moderm</dd>
<dd>styles such as Twerking.</dd></p>
<p>Arctic robot dance
<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have</dd>
<dd>discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants</dd>
<dd>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this</dd>
<dd>because they were really cold.</dd></p><br>
